    <h2>The TL;DR</h2>
    <p>
      After fourteen years as an English language instructor and materials
      writer, specializing in computer assisted language learning, I was ready
      for a fresh challenge. I found it in the Code Chrysalis Software
      Engineering Program. Post-bootcamp, I'm looking forward to applying my
      education expertise and programming skills to my next role.
