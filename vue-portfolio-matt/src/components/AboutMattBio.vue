      After fourteen years as an English language instructor and materials
      writer, specializing in computer assisted language learning, I was ready
      for a fresh challenge. I found it in the Code Chrysalis Software
      Engineering Program. Post-bootcamp, I have been actively contributing in
      open source projects such as Find-aDoc while looking for full-time
      software engineering opportunities.
